{"name":"Hovercraft","tagline":"JQuery library of web hover effects for buttons and links","body":"### Hovercraft\r\nHovercraft is a JQuery library of web hover effects, built for use on buttons, links, text, and more. It includes markup, code, and style for simple effects, and also pre-styled elements and links for drop-down menus and social media. Hovercraft was inspired by my frequent need of hover effects, and how little I enjoyed re-typing the code. Thus, everytime I create something new, it will be added to this library for all to enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Updates\r\n**v.1.0:** just a few simple effects, along with social media hover links\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n@alec-hewitt is the main contributor to this project.\r\nVisit my website! www.ahewdev.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
